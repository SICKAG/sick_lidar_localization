# Definition of ROS service SickDevSetLidarConfig for sick localization
# Sets the configuration for a lidar
# Example call (ROS1):
# rosservice call SickDevSetLidarConfig "{index: 0, minrange: 100, maxrange: 200000, minangle: -15000, maxangle: 15000, x: 1000, y: -1000, yaw: 2000, upsidedown: true, ip: 192.168.0.123, port: 2111, interfacetype: 0, maplayer: 0, active: true}"
# Example call (ROS2):
